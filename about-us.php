            <p>New York City Cricket Club, also known as <strong>NYCCC</strong> was founded in 1999, and is one of the oldest cricket clubs in New York. The club has been part of Commonwealth Cricket League, largest in USA consisting of over 75+ teams.<br/> <br/> 
<strong>Our founders are also the pioneers of the world-renowned cricket website: www.cricinfo.com now under the ESPN flagship.</strong>  <br/> <br/> 
The members of the club come from multiple cricket playing nations: our current roster includes players from Pakistan, India and Sri Lanka.<br/> <br/> 
The club is distinguished by its fixture list and its progressive focus on ensuring youth development beyond cricket. Our mission is to help young cricketers network with professionals and provide them with a platform to focus on their careers.<br/> <br/> 
We are regularly invited to tour clubs in Canada, Rhode Island and Florida. In the summer, we play friendly cricket on Saturdays and league cricket, on Sundays.<br/> <br/>  
We warmly welcome cricket players and enthusiasts of all backgrounds and playing abilities to take an interest in the club and to join us. Anyone interested — as players or spectators — should call<br/> <br/>
